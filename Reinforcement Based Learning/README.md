# Reinforcement Learning Project

## Project Overview

This project contains implementations of two multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems designed to illustrate and optimize decision-making strategies. Each problem is associated with a unique real-world challenge:

1. **Advertisement Optimization Bandit**
2. **Content Personalization Bandit**

Both problems are approached using multi-armed bandit algorithms, allowing for the exploration of new strategies and the exploitation of known profitable options.

## Projects

### 1. Advertisement Optimization Bandit
- **Filename:** `run_mab_advertisement.py`
- **Description:** This problem simulates the challenge faced by news websites in selecting which ads to display to maximize click-through rates. The objective is to dynamically allocate ads to placements to maximize the total number of ad clicks.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Balancing exploration of new ads with exploitation of known profitable ads.
  - Maximizing total ad clicks through optimized ad placement strategies.

### 2. Content Personalization Bandit
- **Filename:** `run_mab_personalization.py`
- **Description:** This problem represents the challenge of recommending content to users on streaming platforms. The goal is to allocate content recommendations to different categories to maximize user engagement based on past behavior and preferences.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Balancing exploration of new content categories with exploitation of known engaging content.
  - Optimizing content recommendations to enhance user satisfaction.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Reinforcement-Learning-Project.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Reinforcement-Learning-Project
    ```

3. **Setup:**
   Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. Typically, you would need libraries such as `numpy` for running the scripts. Install the dependencies with:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Projects:**
   Execute each script to run the respective MAB simulations. For example:
    ```bash
    python run_mab_advertisement.py
    python run_mab_personalization.py
    ```
